          <p> 
            Iron Man (English Iron Man); real name - Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark - a character, published by Marvel Comics and their adaptations, created by writer Stan Lee, screenwriter Larry Lieber and artists Don Hack [en] and Jack Kirby; Iron Man made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense # 39 in March 1963.

In the original version of his biography, Tony Stark, a genius inventor, husband of Vernalia Lodge and a wealthy industrialist with a reputation as a playboy, suffers from the injury he received in captivity, where he was forced to develop weapons of mass destruction for terrorists. Instead, he creates a high-tech armor suit, with which he escapes from captivity. Stark later upgrades his armor with weapons and devices created from his company's resources, and uses armor to protect the world in the guise of Iron Man, while hiding his identity for the first time.

          <h3>Captain America</h3>
          <h5 class="post-info">Created on 23.03.2020, Author: user</h5>
          <p> 
            Captain America (real name - Steven "Steve" Rogers) - a superhero from Marvel Comics. It was created by writer Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby. He first appeared in Captain America Comics # 1 (March 1941), the predecessor of Marvel Comics of the 1940s, Timely Comics. According to various estimates, about 210 million copies of Captain America comics have been sold in a total of 75 countries.

In the comics themselves, the address "Captain America" ​​applies to anyone who is elected by the US government (who considers himself the "owner" of the person), wears a suit and shield. However, almost the entire history of Captain America's publications has been the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a sickly young man who was strengthened with experimental serum to the peak of human perfection to help US military operations. Captain America is dressed in a suit painted on the motif of the American flag, and armed with an indestructible shield that can be used as a weapon.

          <h3>Thor</h3>
          <h5 class="post-info">Created on 03.04.2020, Author: Admin</h5>
          <p> 
            Thor (Old Norse: Þórr, Old English: Þunor, German: Donar or Donner) is a red-haired and red-bearded god of thunder and lightning in Germanic and Norse mythology, the son of Odin and the (three-born) Goddess of the Earth, Jord. While Odin was the god of the aristocracy, Thor is mainly the god of the common people and often sided with mortals against other gods. Thor is the hero of the human race, defending him from enemies, although he lost the competition in strength to the old woman Ellie ("old age"). During Ragnarok, Thor kills Yormungand's snake and dies himself from its venom. Thor's Palace is Bilskirnir in Trudheim.

Thor is often mentioned in Snorri Sturluson's Eddie, where his fights with giants are the main stories. Snorri portrays Thor as a direct god, not necessarily the wisest or most intelligent of the gods, for example, the mysterious Utgard-Loki with his magic spells often fools him.
